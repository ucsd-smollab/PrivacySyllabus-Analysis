Rochester University,CSC,299-1,Social Implications of Computing,"Computers and the Internet, perhaps more than any other technology, have transformed society over the past 50 years. In developed nations, at least, they have enabled dramatic increases in human productivity; an explosion of options for news, entertainment, and communication; and fundamental breakthroughs in almost every branch of science and engineering. At the same time, they have contributed to unprecedented threats to privacy; whole new categories of crime and anti-social behavior; major disruptions in the job market; and the large-scale concentration of risk into systems capable of catastrophic failure. In this discussion- and writing-oriented class, we will consider all of this and more, with the goal of better understanding how to shape technological change in ways that maximize the benefits and minimize the costs.

Even then, the growing power and impact of computing was making this an increasingly relevant question for computing professionals. Today, that power and that impact is of a degree and kind that was almost unimaginable 42 years ago and, as a result, the question is even more profound now than it was then. Computing is now far more pervasive and embedded than when Weizenbaum wrote. It permeates our lives and environment. Cars are now computing platforms on wheels, with all the safety, security, and privacy issues that fact brings with it. Inscrutable algorithms make crucial decisions about people with and without human participation, generating concerns about transparency and fairness.

Anonymous channels can help the Iranian protester who wishes to inform the world what is happening in the streets of Tehran by tweeting videos and the netizen in Moscow who wants to read the BBC news (currently banned in Russia). We could use Tor (i.e., “The onion router,” inspired by Chaum's onion routing idea) or VPN, but both are easily blocked, and neither guarantees privacy from the adversary with full view of the network traffic (e.g., a standard model for a resourceful ISP- or AS-level adversary).

The question is motivated by the risks to privacy that come alongside the societal benefits from sharing and analyzing data. Researchers of privacy have demonstrated in the last two decades that traditional approaches to privacy, such as de-identification of data by the removal of personally identifiable information, can fail to provide sufficient privacy. We will examine differential privacy, a concept that allows precisely stating and proving that individual-specific information does not leak in an analysis. This line of work, originating in theoretical computer science, has established connections to many areas of research including statistics, learning theory, cryptography, computational complexity, convex geometry, mechanism design, databases, programming languages, computer security, statistics, and law and policy. In this course we will focus on the theory underlying differential privacy and attempt to draw a map of its connections to other research areas. We will also try to touch on efforts to bring differential privacy to practice, and on alternative approaches that are outside the scope of differential privacy. At the end of this course students should be acquainted with problems that are focus of current research and have the knowledge to understand this research.",https://sitearchives.georgetown.edu/courses/indexd154.html?Action=List&ProgramID=16&AcademicYear=2016&AcademicTerm=FallSpring,Kobbi Nissim,kobbi.nissim@georgetown.edu,,,,,,

Since secret codes are based on mathematical ideas, each new kind of encryption method leads in this course to the study of new mathematical ideas and results. The first part of the course deals with permutation-based codes: substitutional ciphers, transpositional codes, and Vigenere ciphers. In the second part of the course, the subject moves to bit stream encryption methods. These inlcude block cipher schemes such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES).

We all share personal information on a daily basis with a wide range of organizations. Although at times such sharing can be intentional and beneficial for the user, other times information is shared against the user's will, used for purposes that the user did not expect, revealed to entities other than those approved by the user, or used to infer additional information that the user did not intend to reveal. In this course, students will learn to reason about what information is revealed through the use of computer systems. They will study several different scenarios in which information sharing is either unavoidable or to some extent desirable, and discuss the balance between the benefits and costs of sharing. Finally, students will learn about several privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), and how these can be put to use by software developers to defend the privacy of their users.",https://courses.sci.pitt.edu/courses/view/CS-1657,William Garrison,bill@cs.pitt.edu,,,,,,
